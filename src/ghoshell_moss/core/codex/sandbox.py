"""
Module-level sandbox for safe, stateful Python code execution.

Motivation
----------
Existing Compiler creates a ModuleType, compiles source into it once, and
discards the container. It has no builtins control, no lifecycle hooks, and
no way to share variables between related execution contexts.

Sandbox answers a different need: give an AI model a persistent Python REPL
where it can write arbitrary code across multiple turns, with dangerous
builtins blocked by default, and with the ability to create child sandboxes
that share the parent's namespace (injected domain objects propagate both ways).

This is the foundation for ModuleEvalChannel — the "thin shell" pattern where
an AI controls a domain object (Playwright browser, pandas DataFrame, ROS node)
by writing raw Python code rather than calling pre-wrapped command functions.

Relationship to Compiler & Executor
------------------------------------
Compiler: one-shot ModuleType creation + source compilation. No persistence.
Executor: wraps Compiler with stdout capture and function calling. Still one-shot.
Sandbox:  persistent ModuleType namespace. Cumulative exec(). Builtins control.
          Parent-child __dict__ sharing. Lifecycle hooks. Self-introspection.

All three share the same ExecutionResult type. They form a spectrum:
  Compiler → Executor → Sandbox
  (stateless) → (one-shot capture) → (stateful REPL)

Usage
-----
Basic::

    s = Sandbox()
    s.exec("x = 1")
    s.exec("y = x + 2")
    r = s.exec("__result__ = y")  # r.returns == 3

With domain object injection (the ModuleEvalChannel pattern)::

    parent = Sandbox()
    parent.set("sqlite3", sqlite3)
    parent.set("conn", sqlite3.connect(":memory:"))

    child = Sandbox(parent=parent)
    # AI writes code in child; side effects visible in parent
    child.exec("conn.execute('CREATE TABLE t (id INT)')")

Builtins control::

    s = Sandbox()                     # default safe set (no __import__, open, ...)
    s = Sandbox(builtins=None)        # unrestricted — full Python builtins
    s = Sandbox(builtins={...})       # custom whitelist

Introspection (for channel api() command)::

    s.get_interface()                 # list all names with types
    s.get_interface("conn")           # detail on a specific name
    s.get_source("my_func")           # source of a sandbox-defined function

Lifecycle::

    def init(sb): sb.set("db", connect_db())
    def destroy(sb): sb.get("db").close()

    with Sandbox(on_init=init, on_destroy=destroy) as sb:
        sb.exec("db.execute(...)")
    # destroy() called automatically on __exit__

# Builtins that are blocked in the default safe configuration.
# __import__ is the most critical — it gates access to the entire stdlib
# and filesystem. Without it, code inside the sandbox cannot import new modules
# (callers pre-import what's needed and inject via on_init or set()).

# A copy of Python's builtins with dangerous functions removed.

# dict literal as a default would risk silent mutation of the global constant).

class Sandbox:
    """Safe, stateful execution environment backed by a ModuleType namespace.

    Think of it as a Python REPL with controlled builtins and lifecycle.
    Each exec() call is cumulative — variables, functions, and classes defined
    in one call are visible in the next. This is the key property that makes it
    suitable for AI-driven incremental code writing.

    Parent-Child Sharing
    --------------------
    When a child Sandbox is created with ``parent=``, the child's
    ``module.__dict__`` IS the parent's ``module.__dict__`` — same reference,
    not a copy. This means:

    - Variables set in the child are immediately visible in the parent
    - Variables set in the parent are immediately visible in the child
    - child.close() does NOT clear the namespace (it belongs to the parent)
    - parent.close() cascades to all children, then clears the namespace

    This design serves the ModuleEvalChannel pattern: the parent holds domain
    objects (Playwright page, sqlite3 connection, pandas DataFrame) that the
    child (the AI's execution context) reads and mutates. When the child is
    done, the parent still has all accumulated state.

    Thread Safety
    -------------
    Sandbox is NOT thread-safe. It's designed for single-threaded use within
    a Channel's execution context. For cross-thread code execution (e.g.,
    Playwright's requirement to run on the main thread), use a Janus bridge
    (queue.Queue + threading.Event) in the layer above — see ModuleEvalChannel.

        Parameters
        ----------
        name:
            Logical name for the sandbox. Used in error messages and as the
            module's ``__name__``. Not required to be unique.
        parent:
            If set, this sandbox shares the parent's ``module.__dict__``.
            Side effects propagate both ways. The parent must not be closed.
        builtins:
            Dict to use as the module's ``__builtins__``. When not provided,
            a child inherits the parent's builtins; a root sandbox uses
            SANDBOX_BUILTINS (safe set: no __import__, open, eval, etc.).
            Pass a custom dict to further restrict. Pass ``None`` for
            unrestricted access (full Python builtins). A child that
            explicitly sets this overrides the shared __dict__'s builtins
            (affecting the parent too — they share the namespace).
        on_init:
            Called immediately after the module is created, before any exec().

            database connections, Playwright page, API clients.
        on_destroy:
            Called during close(), after children are closed but before the
            namespace is cleared. Use this to release external resources.
        source:
            Module source code.  Stored for reflection — get_interface()
            delegates to Reflector which shows source + imported attrs.
            Default ``''``: no source, Reflector output is attr-blocks only.
